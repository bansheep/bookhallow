// Each book read is base 50 pts?
// Winning challenges adds 500 pts?
// Book clubs also add pts?
// Adding a book to a list adds 5 pts
// Maybe every 10 books read in a year is another 500 pts or something?
// Finishing a series adds more pts
// Maybe add additional pts for genres not read frequently or new genres
// The initial fill of books just adds 50pts per book
// Completed series will also add the additional pts
